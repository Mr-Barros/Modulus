# Modulus
Winner playground in Apple's Swift Student Challenge 2025.

Lost in a mysterious plane ruled by the laws of Mathematics, you need to unravel the secrets of Linear Algebra in order to find an escape. Joined by the legendary mathematician Gauss, you'll learn to manipulate vectors, throw magical orbs to modify coordinates, and channel the power of matrices to bend the space around you. In a three-minute experience, Modulus turns math into adventure, puts your mind to the challenge and shows abstract concepts with a visual and engaging approach. The learning process happens naturally, like an explorer coming across the hidden laws of Mathematics.
